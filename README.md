# Python--Filter-app
This is a real-time Face Filter Application built using Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Tkinter. It detects facial landmarks through Mediapipe and overlays fun filters like glasses, crowns, hearts, and a Spiderman mask on live video. The app uses Tkinter for the GUI, allowing users to switch filters and capture images with applied effects.
